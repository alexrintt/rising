## What is it?

A sample portfolio example using a minimal animation that is based on rects rising from the bottom.

## Backstory

Back the old days I did this animation for testing purposes, but since I liked that animation I didn't delete it. And someone opened an issue [alexrintt/alexrintt.github.io/issues/4](https://github.com/alexrintt/alexrintt.github.io/issues/4) asking about this particular animation, so here we are.

I'm also working on this discussion that will explain the logic step-by-step so you can reproduce in any other platform.

I also created a p5.js sketch, so you can edit the code + see the effects, it's available at [p5js.org/alexrintt/rising](https://editor.p5js.org/alexrintt/full/JMamwM8a_).

The animation itself is pretty simple, it uses  plain geometry, that one you learn from elementary school.
